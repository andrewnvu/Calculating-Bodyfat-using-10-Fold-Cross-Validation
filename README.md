# Calculating-Bodyfat-using-10-Fold-Cross-Validation
Given a dataset with 13 measures, find the best combination of measures to predict body fat using a 10-Fold Cross-Validation.

Uses supervised learning or a form of 'bagging' as I apply the model 10 times to find the most accurate combination of predictors for bodyfat percentage.

If you'd like to access the dataset that I have used, please e-mail me: andrew.ngoc.vu@gmail.com.
